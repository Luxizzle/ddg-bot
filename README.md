## Why? Arent there enough bots that do this already?

I couldn't find one that fully implemented the DDG API and i really didnt need all the other stuff those bots gave. I just needed something robust and useful.

## ToDo

- Implement Name type (No clue what this is and i cant get a search with the type).
- Better Exclusive answers.
